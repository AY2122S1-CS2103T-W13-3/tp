### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and
[`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `GameEntryListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `GameEntry` object residing in the `Model`. The graph
and statistics displays also depend on `GameEntryList`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="600"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `GameBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a game entry).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the 
destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `GameBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `GameBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the game book data i.e., all `GameEntry` objects (which are contained in a `GameEntryList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `GameEntry` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
  which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<GameEntry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can
  be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component helps save Game Book data and User Preferences to a json file after every use, and read them from a json file while restarting the app.
* The `Storage` component also plays a key role in supporting other functions such as the analysis of average profits.
* It inherits from both `GameBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one.
* It depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.gamebook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

The below provides a step-by-step break down of the mechanism for adding a game entry. Assume that the user has already
launched `GameBook` and the app has loaded data from storage.

1. The user inputs a command, such as `add /g Poker /s 50 /e 85 /dur 40m /loc Resort World Sentosa Casino
  /dur 50m /date 21/10/2021 15:10` which calls upon `LogicManager#execute()`
2. `GameBookParser` and `AddCommandParser` parses the command. If it is valid, a new `GameEntry` object is created,
  followed by an `AddCommand` object containing the `GameEntry`.
3. `LogicManager#execute()` calls upon `AddCommand#execute()`. Within `AddCommand#execute()`, `ModelManager#addGameEntry()`
  is called, which in turn calls `GameBook#addGameEntry()`. This then calls `GameEntryList#add()`, which adds the new game
  entry to a `List` and sorts it by date.
4. `AddCommand#execute()` then encapsulates the result of the command execution in a new `CommandResult` object
  to its caller. The caller, we recall from Step 3, is `LogicManager#execute()`.
5. To update the storage list, `LogicManager#execute()` then calls `StorageManager#saveGameBook(ReadOnlyGameBook)`,
  which then calls its overloaded method `StorageManager#saveGameBook(ReadOnlyGameBook, Path)`, which calls
  `JsonGameBookStorage#saveGameBook(ReadOnlyGameBook, Path)`
6. Abstracting away the remaining storage details, the new list of game entries is saved in local storage.
7. The updated list, graph and statistics are reflected in GUI, together with feedback to the user retrieved from
  the `CommandResult` object from Step 4.



### Edit feature
Editing a game entry requires user input from the CLI. The `GameBook` parser will check the validity of the input. It
is valid if
* The list of games currently displayed is not empty, and the chosen index is a valid index.
* At least one field is chosen to be edited.
* The formats of all fields entered, such as game type, start amount, end amount, location etc must be in the correct format.

Assume that the user has already launched `GameBook` and the app currently displays this:
![GameBook UI](images/GameBook.png)

The below provides a step-by-step break down of the mechanism for adding a game entry.
1. The user inputs `edit 1 /g Mahjong` which calls upon which calls upon `MainWindow#executeCommand()`.
2. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` passes the user's input to `LogicManager#execute()` to process.
3. `LogicManager#execute()` calls `GameBookParser#parse()` to parse the input.
4. `GameBookParser#parse()` parses the input and returns a `EditCommand`.
5. `GameBookParser` parses the command and returns an `EditCommand`.
6. `LogicManger#execute()` executes `EditCommand` by calling `EditCommand#execute()`.
7. `LogicManager#execute()` selects the `GameEntry` to be edited, creates an edited copy of it, and calls `ModelManager#setGameEntry()`
   to replace the original `GameEntry` with the edited one. It then returns a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager#execute()`.
8. `LogicManager#execute()` calls `Storage` to store the new game entry list and returns `CommandResult` to `MainWindow#executeCommand()`.
9. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` executes `resultDisplay#setFeedbackToUser()` to display the message from `CommandResult` to the user.

The following activity diagram illustrates the process of executing an `edit` command.

![Activity diagram of an edit command](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

### Deleting a Game Entry
Deleting a game entry requires user input from the CLI. The user should obtain the index of the game entry to be deleted
from `GameEntryListPanel`, which will show a list of game entries previously added by the user. The format of input should
be `delete [INDEX]`. `GameBookParser` will check for the validity of the input. It is valid if
* The index specified by the user is bigger than 0 and smaller or equal to the number of game entries in the list.

The below provides a step-by-step break down of the mechanism for deleting a game entry. Assume that the user has already
launched `GameBook` and the app has loaded data from storage. Assume also that the current game entry list contains more than 1 game entry.
1. The user inputs `delete 1` which calls upon `MainWindow#executeCommand()`.
2. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` passes the user's input to `LogicManager#execute()` to process.
3. `LogicManager#execute()` calls `GameBookParser#parse()` to parse the input.
4. `GameBookParser#parse()` parses the input and returns a `DeleteCommand`.
5. `LogicManger#execute()` executes `DeleteCommand` by calling `DeleteCommand#execute()`.
6. `DeleteCommand#execute()` calls `ModelManager#deleteGameEntry()` to delete the game entry from the game entry
   list and returns a `CommandResult`to `LogicManager#execute()`.
7. `LogicManager#execute()` calls `Storage` to store the new game entry list and returns `CommandResult` to `MainWindow#executeCommand()`.
8. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` executes `resultDisplay#setFeedbackToUser()` to display the message from `CommandResult` to the user.

### Graphical Analysis of Average Profits by Date

The graphical feature is facilitated by the `GraphPanel` and `Average` classes along with the `MainWindow` class. 
It is implemented using the JavaFX `LineChart` and `XYSeries` Classes.

`GraphPanel` currently supports two methods:
* `drawGraphOfLatestKDates(int)` - gets the TreeMap with the specified number of latest dates and average profits and adds them to the series and 
  the line chart.
* `updateGameEntryList()` - reassigns the value of the new GameEntry list to the current GameEntry list

In addition, the following method from `Average` is also used:
* `Average#getAverageData()` - returns a TreeMap with the dates as values and average profit as keys

Found below is a step-by-step break down of the mechanism of creating and updating the graph: 
1. Upon initialising the `MainWindow`, a new `GraphPanel` is created with the game entry list from `logic`.
   During this, a new `XYChart.Series` is also initialised.
2. This new `GraphPanel` is then added to the `graphPanelPlaceholder` in the main window after which 
   `GraphPanel#drawGraphOfLatestKDates(int)` is called with the k value of `ModelManager.NUMBER_OF_DATES_TO_PLOT` which is set to 20.
3. When `GraphPanel#drawGraphOfLatestKDates(int)` is called, the data for average profits is added to the `averageProfits` TreeMap by 
   calling `Average#getAverageDate()`on the game entry list.
4. Then, the line chart is cleared and the series is added to the line chart
5. The series is then cleared and then the data from the latest k dates from `averageProfits` is added to the series, after which the 
   graph is plotted.
6. After executing a command, the graph panel is updated by calling the `GraphPanel#updateGameEntryList()` method
    on the graph panel with the updated game entry list. 
7. This resets the value of the current game entry list in the graph panel to the updated game entry list and the graph 
   is drawn again by calling the `GraphPanel#drawGraph()` method.
   
#### Mechanism:
* A `GraphPanel` object is created and initialised in the main window using the filtered list from `Storage`
  `drawGraph()` is called on the graph panel to draw the graph based on existing entries as the user starts the app.
* When the user enters a command, `executeCommand(String commandText)` in MainWindow is run during which
  `clearList()` is called on the graphPanel object
  to clear the existing series after which the command is executed.
* Before returning the result, `updateList()` is called on the graphPanel object to update the value of the
  modified list of game entries.
* This results in a new series being created with `Average#getAverageData()`, when it is called on the updated list
  value to generate a new graph.
* These steps repeat for every command entered by the user until the user exits the app.

### Additional Statistics for Profit 

In addition to the graphical analysis of profits, GameBook also provides additional statistical data for the total 
average and median profit generated. This is done by the `stats.Average` and `stats.Median` classes. 

The `Average` class contains the `Average#getOverallAverage(List<GameEntry>)` method which returns average profit value of all the 
game entries in the list as a `Double` value. The `Median` class contains the `Median#getOverallMedian(List<GameEntry>)` method which returns the 
median profit value of all entries in the list as a `Double` value. 

These methods are then called in the `StatsPanel` class in the UI. The `StatsPanel` class contains
2 methods - `StatsPanel#getStats()` and `StatsPanel#updateStats(ObservableList<GameEntry>)` which are used to set the 
text fields in the UI to the Average and Median values respectively. 

Found below is a step-by-step break down of the mechanism of updating the statistics:
* When the `MainWindow` is initialised, a `StatsPanel` object is created and initialised using a `ObservableList<GameEntry>`
    The values for average and median profit are initialised 0.00 for an empty list
* As the list is updated, `StatsPanel#updateStats(ObservableList<GameEntry>)` is called from `MainWindow` which updates the
  current `ObservableList<GameEntry>` with the new `ObservableList<GameEntry>` and `StatsPanel#getStats()` is called
* Subsequently, `StatsPanel#getStats()` calls the `Average#getOverallAverage(List<GameEntry>)` and `Median#getOverallMedian(List<GameEntry>)`
methods which recalculates the value of the mean and median and resets the value of the text fields in the UI.
