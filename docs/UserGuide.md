## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer (refer to Quick Start) and replace the empty gamebook.json file it creates within the data folder with your `gamebook.json` file in your original computer.

**Q**: Can I edit the data by directly modifying the data file?<br>
**A**: Technically, you can if you follow the exact storage format. However, we strongly advise against it as any
mistakes will cause errors in the app.

**Q**: (Follow up from previous question) What is the storage format of the data file?<br>
**A**: Data is stored in JSON format, with each entry being stored as a JSON object with the keys being `gameEntries`, `startAmount`, `endAmount`, `date`, `durationMinutes`, `location` and `tagged`.
The exact format can be explored by checking out the format of the sample data that GameBook is initialized with. The data file is stored at `/data/gamebook.json`, and the
`data` directory is located in the same directory where you placed the JAR file at.
